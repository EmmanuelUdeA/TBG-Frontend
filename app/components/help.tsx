                    Exchanges can be made by size (subject to availability).
                    If you want to exchange for another reference it is necessary that this has had the same value of the one you purchased (considering your discount).
                    If it is a totally different product than the one you purchased, the value of your purchase will be considered in your favor and you will be able to pay the excess for the new reference.

                    To make the return process, the product must be properly packaged. Use the same packaging in which you received the order or a different one that protects the product during the transportation process.



                    To make an exchange, the product must be in perfect condition, clean, unused, with tags and labels. Exchanges of products for personal use are not allowed (socks, caps, caps and other products for personal use).

                    The exchange of a product can be made up to thirty (30) days after your purchase (Invoice date).
